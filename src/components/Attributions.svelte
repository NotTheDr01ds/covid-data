  <p>I'll attempt to get new data uploaded soon after it is available from the Georgia Department of Public Health.  Updates are approximately Noon and 7pm daily.</p>
  <p>The goal of this page is to show a different view of the reported COVID-19 case counts.  "Total confirmed cases" does not really tell the full story, since some areas have a higher population than others.</p>
  <p>This breakdown shows the confirmed cases relative to the population of each Georgia county, as well as relative to its overall land area.</p>
  <p>Click on any column header to sort.</p>
