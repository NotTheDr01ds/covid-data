  <p>I'll attempt to get new data upload soon after it is available from the Georgia Department of Public Health.  Updates were being done at Noon and 7pm daily, but as of 3/27 they appear to be more sporadic.</p>
  <p>Also hoping to add some new features such as comparisons to the previous day.</p>
